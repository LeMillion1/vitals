"""The tool surface is re-sent with every message of every conversation, and every
read answers with a hundred rows — so three things have to stay true or the budget
quietly doubles again:

  * a serialized row carries data, not bookkeeping and not nulls;
  * a night's minute-by-minute stage timeline arrives on request, not by default,
    and says so when it is folded away (silence would read as "no such data");
  * a switched-off module's tools are not listed at all.
