"""Helpers for the central ``raw_payloads`` JSONB store.

Every external fetch (Hevy workout, Garmin daily metric, an activity) keeps its
full upstream response here parallel to the normalized rows it produces, so a
later schema/parse change never loses data. Both the Hevy and Garmin services
reconcile against existing rows by ``(domain, source, external_id)`` — the
natural lookup key the table is indexed for — so re-syncing refreshes one raw row
per upstream object instead of piling up duplicates.

:func:`upsert_raw_payload` resets ``processed_at`` to ``None`` whenever it
refreshes an existing row ("re-parse pending") — the promise being that
something later sweeps rows still sitting at ``processed_at IS NULL`` and
re-derives their normalized rows from the raw copy. :func:`sweep_domain` is
that sweep, generic over any domain. ``signals_service.reparse_unparsed`` is
the original, domain-specific version of the same idea (predates this one and
stays special-cased — it piggybacks on the morning brief instead of a
schedule of its own; see its docstring).

    extended here so every domain can reuse the same query instead of each
    re-implementing it.

    Picks up to ``limit`` rows for ``domain`` still at ``processed_at IS NULL``
    (what :func:`upsert_raw_payload` leaves behind whenever it refreshes a row)
    within ``since_days`` of ``fetched_at``, excluding rows that already have a
    normalized child. ``has_normalized`` is a caller-built ``EXISTS`` clause
    correlated to ``RawPayload.id`` (e.g. ``select(Model.id).where(Model.
    raw_payload_id == RawPayload.id).exists()``) — passed in rather than
    hard-coded so this function stays domain-agnostic; it never imports a
    domain's own models. ``reparse`` does the actual re-derivation, reusing
    that domain's existing ingest logic.

    A raising ``reparse`` call is logged and skipped so one bad row can't abort
    the batch; ``processed_at`` is stamped only after a row's ``reparse`` call
    returns without raising. Flushes once at the end of the batch, not per row.
    Does not commit — the caller owns the transaction.

    ponytail: a reparse that raises *after* partially writing (e.g. midway
    through a multi-step ingest) leaves ``processed_at IS NULL`` but may
    already have a partial child row, which would make ``has_normalized`` skip
    it on every later sweep too — stuck rather than retried. Narrow edge case
    (most failures here are validation, which happens before any write); add a
    per-row SAVEPOINT (``session.begin_nested()``) around the ``reparse`` call
    if this shows up for real.
