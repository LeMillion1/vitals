"""APScheduler framework for Vitals.

The foundation ships the *framework* + a 1-minute ``keepalive`` heartbeat so
``/health`` can detect a stalled scheduler from day one. Per-module jobs (Hevy
every 6h, Garmin poll, weekly digest, plateau/lab checks) attach by calling
:func:`register_job` at import/startup — no edits here.

Every job runs under the Redis lock (single-runner across workers) and stamps a
heartbeat each tick. Job functions have the signature
``async def job(session_factory, redis) -> None``.
